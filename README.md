## Challenge
### Module 2 in VBA
   Refactored the vba to read the data to figure out all the tickers and find the total daily volume of stock sales, rate of return. Also formatting was added to highlight the stocks which has positive return. Based on our analysis Steve would be able to make quick decision and recommend his Dad for his investment. Though in 2017 DQ stock had really good return of close to 200% the susbequent year it had bad run 62% loss where ENPH had 129% of Profit in 2017 and in 2018 it had 81% of profit, so it would help Steve to make ENPH as stock to be invested.
